# git-branch-assistant

**git-branch-assistant** is a command line application to manage your git repositories. It is built to be used together with [assistant](https://github.com/skagedal/assistant) but can be used as a standalone program. 

## Git cleanup

The `git-branch-assistant git-clean` command cleans up branches in the git repository of the current working directory.

For each local branch, it compares to upstream and gives you a selection of options depending on current state.
